 * on nodes, edges, ...} *)

  object

    (** Load graphviz markup from file and then:
      * 1) render it to PNG, loading the risulting image in the embedded
      *    GtkImage widget
      * 2) render it to a (HTML) map, internalizing its data.
      * Remember that map entries are generated only for nodes, (edges, ...)
      * that have an "href" (or "URL", a synonym) attribute 
      * Interesting values for gviz_cmd are:
      *   'neato'
      *   'dot'
      *   'tred | dot'
      *)

     * (e.g.: [ "shape","rect"; "href","http://foo.bar.com/";
