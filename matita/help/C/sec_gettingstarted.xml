  <title>Getting started</title>
  <para> If you are already familiar with the Calculus of (Co)Inductive
  Constructions (CIC) and with interactive theorem provers with procedural
  proof languages (expecially Coq), getting started with Matita is relatively
  easy. You just need to learn how to type Unicode symbols, how to browse
  and search the library and how to author a proof script.</para>

  <sect1 id="unicode">
   <title>How to type Unicode symbols</title>
   <para>Unicode characters can be typed in several ways:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Using the &quot;Ctrl+Shift+Unicode code&quot; standard Gnome shortcut. E.g. Ctrl+Shift+3a9 generates &quot;Ω&quot;.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><para>Typing the ligature &quot;\name&quot; where &quot;name&quot;
		     is a standard Unicode or LaTeX name for the character or an 
		     ASCII art resembling the shape of the character. Pressing
      &quot;Alt+L&quot; or Space or Enter just after the last character 
      of the name converts
      the ligature to the Unicode symbol. 
      E.g. &quot;\Delta&quot; followed by Alt+L generates
      &quot;Δ&quot;, while pressing Alt-L after &quot;=>&quot; generates
      &quot;⇒&quot;</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
	     <para>Typing a symbol and rotating trough its equivalence class
		   with Alt-L. E.g. pressing Alt-L after an  &quot;l&quot;
		   generates a &quot;λ&quot;, while pressing Alt-L after an
		   &quot;→&quot; once generates &quot;⇉&quot; and pressing
		   Alt-L again generates &quot;⇒&quot;.
         </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
    The comprehensive list of symbols names or shortcuts and their equivalence
    classes is available clicking on the &quot;TeX/UTF-8 table&quot; item
    of the &quot;View&quot; menu.
    </para>
    <para>
	    There is a memory mechanism related to equivalence classes that
	    remembers your last choice, making it the default one. For example,
	    if you use &quot;_&quot; to generate &quot;⎻&quot; 
	    (that is the third choice, after &quot;⎽&quot; and &quot;⎼&quot;), 
	    the next time you type Alt-L
	    after &quot;_&quot; you immediately get &quot;⎻&quot;.

  <sect1 id="cicbrowser">
   <title>Browsing and searching</title>
   <para>The CIC browser is used to browse and search the library.
    You can open a new CIC browser selecting &quot;New Cic Browser&quot;
    from the &quot;View&quot; menu of Matita, or by pressing &quot;F3&quot;.
    The CIC browser is similar to a traditional Web browser.</para>
   <sect2 id="browsinglib">
    <title>Browsing the library</title>
    <para>To browse the library, type in the location bar the absolute URI of
    the theorem, definition or library fragment you are interested in.
    &quot;cic:/&quot; is the root of the library. Contributions developed
    in Matita are under &quot;cic:/matita&quot;; all the others are
    part of the library of Coq.</para>
    <para>Following the hyperlinks it is possible to navigate in the Web
    of mathematical notions. Proof are rendered in pseudo-natural language
    and mathematical notation is used for formulae. For now, mathematical
    notation must be included in the current script to be activated, but we
    plan to remove this limitation.</para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2 id="aboutproof">
    <title>Looking at a proof under development</title>
    <para>A proof under development is not yet part of the library.
     The special URI &quot;about:proof&quot; can be used to browse the
     proof currently under development, if there is one.
     The &quot;home&quot; button of the CIC browser sets the location bar to
     &quot;about:proof&quot;.
    </para>

   <sect2 id="whelp">
    <title>Searching the library</title>
    <para>The query bar of the CIC browser can be used to search the library
     of Matita for theorems or definitions that match certain criteria.
     The criteria is given by typing a term in the query bar and selecting
     an action in the drop down menu right of it.</para>

   <sect2 id="compilation">
   <title>How to compile a script</title>
   <para>
	Scripts are compiled to base URIs. Base URIs are of the form
	&quot;cic:/matita/path&quot; and are given once for all for a set
	of scripts using the &quot;root&quot; file. 
   </para>
   <para>
	A &quot;root&quot; file has to be placed in the root of a script set,
	for example, consider the following files and directories, and
	assume you keep files in &quot;list&quot; separated from files
	in &quot;sort&quot; (for example the former directory may contain
	functions and proofs about lists, while latter sorting algorithms
	for lists):
<programlisting><![CDATA[
  list/
    list.ma (* depending just on the standard library *)
    utils/
      swap.ma (* including list.ma *)
  sort/
    qsort.ma (* including utils/swap.ma *)
]]></programlisting>
	To be able to compile properly the contents of &quot;list&quot;
	a file called root has to be placed in it. The file should be like
	the following snippet.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
  baseuri=cic:/matita/mydatastructures
]]></programlisting>
	This file tells &appname; that objects generated by 
	&quot;list.ma&quot; have to be placed in 
	&quot;cic:/matita/mydatastructures/list&quot; while 
	objects generated by 
	&quot;swap.ma&quot; have to be placed in 
	&quot;cic:/matita/mydatastructures/utils/swap&quot;.
  </para>
  <para>
	Once you created the root file, you must generate a depend file.
	Enter the &quot;list&quot; directory (the root of yuor file set)
	and type &quot;matitadep&quot;. Remember to regenerate the depend file
	every time you alter the dependencies of your files (for example 
	including other scripts).
	You can now compile you files typing &quot;matitac&quot;.
  </para>
  <para>
	  To compile the &quot;sort&quot; directory, create a root file
	  in &quot;sort/&quot; like the following one and then run 
	  &quot;matitadep&quot;.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
  baseuri=cic:/matita/myalgorithms
  include_paths=../list
]]></programlisting>
	The include_paths field can declare a list of paths separated by space.
	Please omit any &quot;/&quot; from the end of base URIs or paths.
